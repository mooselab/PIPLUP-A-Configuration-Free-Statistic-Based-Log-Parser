VarExam
# Basic Requirements:
- I will provide multiple log messages, each delimited by backticks.
- You must identify and extract all dynamic variables in each log with {placeholder} and output static log templates.
- Identify the semantics of variables and compare the differences between logs to identify potential dynamic variables if they belong to the same template.
- Preserve any dynamic variables already marked by `<*>` or `{placeholder}`.
- Pay attention to the slightly different strings among logs, which have high possibility to be dynamic variable.
- Do not convert non-variables, especially when only one log is presented in the group.
# Advices on variables:
- Common variables: numbers, IP addresses, URLs, file paths, directories, hex values, usernames, etc.
- Full directory with filename, complex url with server address or domain should be recognize as one variable.
# Advices on non-variables:
- Error messages/types, java exceptions, detailed commands or interrupted messages are NOT dynamic variables as they contain important information.
- Specific actions or status words are NOT dynamic variables.
# Variable Examples: 
- `/var/www/html/xxx` -> `{directory}`
- `/var/lib/zookeeper/log.000000001` -> `{file}`
- `blk_-1234567832142354978` -> `{blk_id}`
- `com.huawei.health.manager.Service@32a6bf8` -> `{api}`
- `2017-07-02 15:46:40.536` -> `{time}`
- `192.168.0.1:8008` -> `{ip_or_url}`
# Output Constraints: 
- For each log line, output corresponding log template starting with LogTemplate[idx], no other line break. 
- Each input log's template is delimited by backticks.
